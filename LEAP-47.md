## Simple Summary
Sell Lyra's OP stack

## Motivation
Crypto is pvp, OP was kind enough to grant us their tokens and it is up to the DAO to make use of their value. Perp protcol already dumped theirs and now we have a chance to be pro tradooors. 

## Specification
<!--The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature, there are five sections
1. Overview
2. Rationale
3. Technical Specification
4. Test Cases
5. Configurable Values
-->

### Overview
Sell all OP tokens asap

### Rationale
Optimism is a low float useless scem gov token that has been squeezed up by this recent $ETH run. There is a good chance this is the most the token will be worth in the long run. Instead of using OP tokens to brrr lyra that indirectly get sold by the users farming it. We can expedite this process by selling now

### Technical Specification
dont think its tough technically, just need to sell
